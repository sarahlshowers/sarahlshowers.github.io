			<h3>Conflict</h3>
			<p>08.11.14</p>
			<article>
				<p>Has somebody ever criticized you at work, a peer, a manager? I don't know about you but it can be a pretty hard pill to swallow and no matter how hard you try. "Don't take it personal" they say, not always the easiest thing. My current manager doesn't deal with conflict well and I find his passive aggressive way of handling things super frustrating.</p>

				<p>My first week out of training was also one of the busiest weekends of the entire year. A huge (I'm talking taking over the city) convention dropped into San Jose. It was truly a sink or swim style initiation, with a section of 8 tables plus hundreds of people in between wanting cocktail service, trying to juggle everything and fight through crowds of people who refuse to move with a tray of drinks and trying not to spill anything was, well, a challenge. To put it into context, take any major event you have been to and remember how it was to try and get through the crowd. People packed tightly together and jostling each other - in this case as they danced or generally moved around.</p>

				<p> So, most bars, lounges, and restaurants usually have standards for how long you have to greet a table, take an order, return with said order etc., that was out the window. It was insane, to say the least. So imagine my frustration as the new kid barely managing to tread water, when my manager blows by with drinks in his hand and comments that the time on my drinks was eight minutes (the standard is five), without pausing. WOW! Was I mad. No "are you ok", "do you need help", didn't even stop to let me explain why.</p>

				<p>I eventually sought him out and let him know my feelings and was quite honest that I needed help. He responded that I should have asked for it... yes, I knew all of this. After 13 years in the industry, I kind of get how it works so I told him, that if he was been around to ask for help, in fact, if any manager had been around, I would have asked for help.</p>

				<p>I honestly have had so many frustrating finger pointing ordeals with this particular manager and after talking to others and just observing him in the operation. He doesn't deal with stress well, high volume or conflict. The type of guy where you have a guest issue and he nods he head and shrugs his shoulders but does nothing to help rectify the issue. Pretty stellar attitude for a manager who works at a place where the culture is founded on "Turning moments into memories for our guests". I guess he's going with any moment into a memory, good or bad.</p>

				<p>My exit interview with HR was so great to be able to get off my chest how it was to work for someone who really didn't care to get involved with the guest. To do whatever he could to take care of them, to make them want to come back. Knowing that it was most, if not all of the staff felt the same way assured me that it wasn't just me being a bitch, because I definitely felt that way. I now know, that the reason he kept walking as he told me off that day was because he didn't want to give me a chance to respond.</p>

				<p>Having been a manager in hospitality, I know that dealing with conflict, coming from guests or employees is never fun but I would never run away from it. Even more so now than ever before. Nobody likes to deal with it but I recognize the importance of addressing the issue at hand and not running away from it, like ripping off a band-aid, it's better to face it, get it over with and then it's done.</p>
