				<h3>Thinking and Growing and Growing and Thinking</h3>
				<h4>Thinking Style</h4>
				<p>I got equal high scores of 40 for both concrete sequential and abstract random
				I like facts to be based in reality and process information in ordered/sequential fashion (I definitely worked through my tasks this week, one-by-one, not even looking at the next until I completed the current project).
				I also organize information through reflection - I like to take notes as I go using good old fashioned pen and paper, and use that information to rehash my learning using these notes. It definitely helps with my reflections!</p>

				<h4>VARK</h4>
				<p>I am multimodal - I went through all off the learning styles and made notes of the things from each I thought applied most to my personal learning style.
				I like interesting examples that are relatable and I like to explain through my though process to others
				I like to retell stories of my learning and things I come across
				I use lists and headings to organize my notes with bullets and highlighting
				I like to rewrite my notes in a structured way after taking brief notes that highlight the important facts
				I definitely work a lot using trial and error. It can get frustrating to others but I want to just try it out rather than talk it though, I find I need to do things to understand</p>
