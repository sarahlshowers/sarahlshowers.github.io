				<p>I want to explore computer memory and a topic that is pretty interesting to me!</p>

				<p>One of the things I love about technology is it’s constant evolution. I remember as a child, taking my family computer to a local computer shop to have extra memory installed above and beyond the whopping 40MB it came with and as technology advanced, buying external devices to hold all of the extra data. Now my computer has the capability to store information in the 100’s of gigabytes plus a terabyte of external hard drive storage. That’s crazy! Even in the past six years I have gone from 1GB of storage on my iPhone to 16GB plus 5GB of iCloud storage that houses my iPhone's and iPad's synchronized data, with the option to purchase up to 50GB extra, should I need to.</p>

				<p>I love that I can pick up my MacBook, my iPad, my iPhone and all of them contain the same synced information. Beyond even that, I can read a book on a Kindle, put it down, then pick up where I left off on another device, not even the same brand of technology. How does cloud technology work? Where does it store the mountains of data needed to keep millions of people connected and synced no matter where they are? Just how much will the future of cloud computing better our everyday lives? The last time I had to actually install anything on my phone was when I got a new handset, otherwise the cloud takes care of app updates, software updates, and I’m sure countless other things for me. I don’t even store documents on my computer’s hard drive anymore, I use Dropbox. So where do all of my files live if they aren’t on my computer? I imagine millions of tiny pieces dancing above my head, kind of like when Mike TV get transported on Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, even though I know that in actuality that is not at all true, I’m intrigued to learn more about cloud based technology, it seems to be more and more prevalent but I’ll be damned if I know how it works. I think it's a good time to explore!</p>

				<p>In it's simplest form, cloud technology refers to storing and acessing data and programs over the internet. For it to be considered "cloud computing," you need to access your data or your programs over the Internet, or at the very least, have that data synchronized with other information over the Net. This level of cloud computing refers to the consumer not business, that's a whole other story. Some examples that I am familar with and use regularly are, Apple iCloud as I already described and more recently. iCloud lets you access your music, photos, documents, and more from whatever device you’re on. iCloud puts your content on all your devices, everywhere, automatically. That’s the way it should be, and iCloud makes it a reality. So when you buy a song, you don’t have to download it over and over to enjoy it on multiple devices. Or worry that a document doesn’t contain your latest revisions. Or spend time transferring photos. iCloud takes care of everything for you. Just like that.</p>

				<p>Remember when you wanted to sync your phone or on launch day you had to plug your phone into your computer, wait forever for it to back up adn then another eternity for it to download the new stuff. Now, the iCloud service allows users to wirelessly back up their iOS devices to iCloud instead of manually doing so using iTunes and any time the phone it locked, pluged in and connected to wi-fi your phone will search for updates and push them to your phone.</p>
