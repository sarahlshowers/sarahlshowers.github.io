			<h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
			<p>07.31.14</p>
			<article>
				<p>I am nervous to write about this and usually, I am quick to put "pen to paper", as it were and spew out what is on my mind but, this time I'm worried. I'm worried I will say the wrong thing...</p>

				<p>As a white female, who grew up in a very white neighbourhood - I remember one black girl and one Indian Asian boy in my high school of 1000+ kids, it's hard for me to really think of a time where I have had to deal with any kind of a stereotype threat. I do remember, these two kids; Emma Carter, in the year above me and Amir Aslam, who was in my form and I saw every day. I don't remember any thing else because in my eyes, I saw them both as another kid that went to my school.</p>

				<p>It wasn't until I came to the US to take part in a Disney International College program at the age of 20 that I was really thrown into an environment where I lived and worked with people of diverse backgrounds. I lived in a shared apartment of 6 girls, 3 from Hong Kong and 3 from the UK. We butted heads - it was them against us. They were loud, they were messy, nothing that necesarily to being because of who they are or where they are from. My one room mate, started throwing aroudn sterotypes, I knew nothing about Hong Kong, just that Disney was trying to help train people for it's new park opening in Hong Kong in the next year. I remember Stephanie, one of the girls from HK put regular dish soap in the dishwasher and it flooded the kitchen... I thought it was hilarious, I didn't have a dishwasher either and in the absence of actual dishwasher detergent, I'd quite possibly have done the same thing but, Sam lost her shit. That was the start of her trying to rally the three of us and pit us against the three of them. It was hard. The language barrier definitley worked against us all in trying to stop the house from becoming divided. </p>

				<p>Similarly, when I was 23 I returned to do a second program I lived with another Brit, 2 Mexicans, and 2 Brazilians. Let's just say, the Mexcans lived up to their sterotype - they were loud, they partied, ALL THE TIME. They made smelly food but it was the start of something. I lived with these girls for a year, last time we were all frazzled after three months. Maybe because when they made that food, they shared it with us all, maybe because when it got late, they invited us to the party or moved on to some place else because we wanted to call it a night. I don't know. Maybe, we were just that little bit older and a little bit wiser?</p>

				<p>Since then I have lived in Orlando, where 50% of the populataion is Caucasian, 28% African American and 25.4% Hispanic. To Philadelphia where 41% were Caucasian amd 43.4% is African American to most recently, San Jose: 33.2% Hispanic, 31.7% Asian, 28.7% Caucasian. What do these numbers mean to me in terms of sterotype threat. I would say nothing, at least to me, I do not feel any different here than I did where I grew up where 98% of the population was white. It's hard to have a voice on a topic that until considering this career move, I hadn't felt. Sterotype has never play a part in my life that I have ever really worried about or been aware of, at least. Now as a female readying to play ball in the boys club, for the first time, I find myself considering who I am, who I'll be, and how I'll be that person. I'm not saying it's the same but it's the closest I've come to feeling any kind of sterotype threat.</p>
