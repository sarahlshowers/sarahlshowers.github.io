				<p>ARGH! You know what really grids my gears? When people ask questions on Facebook... dumb questions when they clearly haven't done a lick of research on their own. They're too lazy or they used Google but their results weren't good because they weren't able to compose a good question.</p>

				<p>There is an art to the Google. If you simply want to know how to convert a weight measurement from pounds to grams, you ask, "How many grams are in 100lbs?" and you will get a result. More recently, in the last 9 weeks, specifically, I have noticed that asking questions this way when I am researching a solution to a problem I'm working on at DBC doesn't always work as well.</p>

				<p>Here's what I now know to be more useful. Say I want to set up a web page with a three column layout. All I need to type is "HTML/CSS three column layout". Another example, I want to know more about what attr: reader means, so maybe I'll search fro "Ruby getter setter". With most DBC topics I look to stackoverflow results and from there I usually find a pretty close answer and from that I am able to refine my search.</p>

				<p>Two weeks ago, I was reviewing a peers work and came across the use of "//" in his code. I hadn't seen it before and try doing a Google search for two forward slashes, it doesn't return anything useful related to that just a selection of articles about Ruby. They key to finding out my answer was to ask a smarter question, I tried changing my Google search to no avail so I asked a person. I didn't know it was a regex at this point, once I got that lead it was much easier to conduct my search.</p>
