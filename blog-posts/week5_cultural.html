			<h2>Pairing is Caring</h2>
			<p>07.24.14</p>
			<article>
				<p>I love pairing. It took me a few weeks to get comfortable with it, as an extrovert with introverted tendencies (read-up on Myers-Briggs Type Indicators to learn how such contradicotry statements can be true <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator">MBTI</a>).</p>

				<p>I digress, my point is that I am not good with strangers even though it may not appear to be that way based on first impressions. I'm also THAT person, I hate making phone calls, I'm a die-hard texter, so to couple strangers and phone-call-esque scenarios is my idea of a nightmare. However, I decided I would grit my teeth and do the minimum required just to get through...</p>

				<p>Silly rabbit, I would quickly come to realize that those pairing sessions are so much more fruitful than hacking through solutions on your own. This week, I actually have three or four set up and my GPS. I'm starting to really look forward to those pairing sessions. I take a lot away from them, more than just a solution to a problem. It's the foundation of a friendship, a brotherhood, building a camaraderie that I forsee lasting beyond the 9 weeks of DBC. I discover that I'm not in this alone as the only new person that is struggling to figure it out, whatever "it" may be on that given week.</p>

				<p>More recently, I have found it more beneficial to take 30-60 minutes prior to my PPS to look into the problem and start researching and working through the challenge. I'm finding it results in a better use of the time, less quiet time spent researching... or maybe I'm starting to get this?!</p>

				<p>The biggest thing, I have found in regards to feedback is; is my feedback useful? My first two or three ratings I recieved on my feedback were not always rated so high, especially on the actionable category. It made me evaluate, what can I do to make this more useful to my peer?</p>

				<p>If I could take a moment to be completely honest though - I find writing feedback tiresome. I would much rather take the time at the end of a session to verbally give feedback. I have been in a management position, so to me, it isn't awkward or difficult to give feedback whether good or bad. I just don't like the time it absorbs when I could be working on other things. Precious minutes add up, I could be tweaking my site, re-reading my blogs for typos and reformatting to make them more pleasing to the eye. As it stands, I mostly get done what I have to get done each week and have very little time for much else, 6-8 reviews that you have to search through to find someone with issues enabled that has completed the challenge coupled with leaving feedback for multiple peerpairing sessions is not a good use of my time.</p>
