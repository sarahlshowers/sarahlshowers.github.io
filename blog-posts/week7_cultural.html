				<p>Adventure and Courage - these are the values that come to mind when I think about how happy this following scenario has made me, proud that we took the chance and satisfied that the gamble paid off:</p>

				<p>This time last year, my husband and I had been approved for a second mortgage and were looking at property in the Philadelphia suburbs. By Thanksgiving everything had changed, we chose to drop everything and move to California. Something we had talked about doing when we retire, like our version of the American Dream.</p>

				<p>Derrick quit his full-time job and I put in for a transfer with the restaurant. We were going to gamble on the chance that a web dev job would be easy to find in Silicon Valley.</p>

				<p>Adventure and courage had everything to do with this move. The courage to quit and use all of our savings to follow our hearts and enjoy the adventure of driving cross country to a city we had never even visited. I think this is a great way to live when you are in the situation my husband and I are. It would be a lot harder with the second home and if children were in the picture. It was a now or never decision and it wasn't difficult to make... Can we live this way forever? No, I think it would eventually bite us in the butt but, for now these moments have worked out for us. Now it's my turn to give up everything for DBC and fingers crossed, it works out equally as well.</p>

				<p>Personality-wise, I'm a bit of a closed book. I'm probably not the first person anyone would come to for advice but, not too long ago, I offered up some relationship advice for a friend of mine. I always believe that loyalty is important and start to build a relationship foundation based on friendship, after all, my husband is my best friend, so it's a value I believe in pretty strongly. Romance is important but being honest and true to yourself and being who you are is also something to consider, keeping up the facade when you build a relationship based on being someone you're not, well I can imagine it's stressful.</p>

				<p>Friendship, openness, and compassion - I think friendship will get us a long way at DBC. Being able to lean on one another, pick each other up, and share openly our frustrations. These are all qualities I'm finding in many of my peers and knowing that I'm not alone, not the only one gives me the boost I need to keep moving forward.</p>
