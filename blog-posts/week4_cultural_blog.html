			<h3>It's a man's world...</h3>

				<p>With apps like snapchat, developed to by Stanford college kids, it definitely has a dark-side, or titstare, that has the sole purpose of taking your picture while staring a pictures of women's breasts. It's easy to forget that, even with so much progress made in our modern society, you can still be made to feel like an outsider. These are definitely a couple of more extreme examples, but even on a personal level, tech meet-ups always seem to be overwhelmingly comprised of younger, white men - and now, maybe I'm the one creating a stereotype of my own, but it's a feeling I get as a newcomer that it's a "bro's club". In world that has somewhat developed the reputation of being comprised of sexist, alpha-male types, it take a certain type of female to fit it. So, as a newcomer and a female, what do you do when something isn't quite right, be it a joke or your peer is posting things to Facebook that you think are more than a little offensive? When do you act on it and when do you just play along, for fear of being shut-out?</p>

				<p>First of all, why is it so important to fit it? Well, think about it, haven't we all spent out whole lives just trying to belong? To anybody that say no, they never have - I find it hard to believe you, so let me give you a personal example; It breaks my heart that every time I get to talking about my heritage and people learn that I'm British, I hear "you don't have an accent". I don't now why, I wasn't particularly young when I relocated but, now I've been put on the spot and I can't explain it, I don't know, I don't like it and, maybe the only way I can explain it is that, maybe I was paranoid when people couldn't understand me, I hate that people question words, I mean I speak English yet, asking for butter or water is really hard sometimes - I have had to ask my husband to translate! Reallyâ€¦ true story, that has happened to me, many times! So, maybe I just wanted to fit it. While it's not the same, it definitely is a personal example I can give of wanting to belong, be normal, not feel like an outsider.</p>

				<p>It's the idiots, the short-sighted jerks that create these feelings at all levels, not just male to female, I feel it too as a British ex-pat in the United States, maybe even more that way - is the answer to just embrace it and become on of the "bros" or walk away from it? Does accepting it mean you don't care? Is there really anything you can do about it? Change it or leave?</p>

				<p>It wasn't always this way. Modern culture is embracing the mid-90s in dramas like Mad Men, an era where women and computers were commonplace - to be a secretary was a dream of the housewife that wanted a career, which is why I am thankful that I don't live in the world my grandmother did, she stayed home, raised five kids, and never even learned to drive. Now, as an older woman and recently widowed, she has no job, no companion, no career. She sits home an knits in front of the TV, relying on family member to come visit her or help her run errands.</p>

				<p>I am not held back by that, I was the first person in my family, ever to go to college and graduate with a degree. I have lived and worked in some amazing places and now, at the beginning of an exciting new adventure, because unlink my grandmother, I have husband who is excited to support my journey into the tech world. I am inspired by him, he quit his job, went back to school and got hired right after he graduated by eBay. Two years later, he wanted to move, to grow - well, Philly isn't exactly the hub of the tech world, so he told me to put in for a transfer, quit his job and we moved to Silicon Valley, got hired by Apple, six months later applied to LinkedIn, just because - now he works full-time there. Now it's my turn to be a little but reckless and I couldn't be more excited!</p>

				<p>I aspire to be like Sheryl Sandberg, she believes in women speaking up, becoming leaders in their work place but still having enough balance to live a normal life. I know that jobs can be based on merit, does that mean staying at the office until 8pm? Not to her, she leaves the office at 5:30 and eats dinner with her family five nights a week. Right now, I do that maybe once or twice, on my days off. Fortunately, there are many social groups for women in tech and I plan to take advantage of them. The resources are here and I would be crazy not to use them.</p>
