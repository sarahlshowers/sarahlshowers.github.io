				<h3>JavaScript - The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly</h3>
				<p>I am of the school that believes there isn't one best single language but I will attempt to answer the question, of why JavaScript is popular as a language and also address some of the limitations.</p>

				<p>JavaScript is the programming language that brings animation, games, apps, interactivity, and other dynamic effects to life.</p>

				<p>One article suggested JavaScript as a good jumping off point when looking to learn to code.</br>
				<em>"The language is available everywhere, growing rapidly and offers virtually unlimited online resources. Learning JavaScript first may also help you avoid some of the confusion experienced by developers coming from other languages."</em></p>

				<p>An expert in client-side JavaScript can quickly become an expert in server-side JavaScript. Plus, JavaScript is arguably the most popular programming language in the world, so there are quite a few people who are already good at it.</p>

				<p>One of the downsides that I came across multiple times, is the security issues that come with using JavaScript. Bad people know it can be manipulated, which leads users to disable it, which in turn leads to another con, that the code renders differently for everyone because not all users always have JavaScript enables.</p>
