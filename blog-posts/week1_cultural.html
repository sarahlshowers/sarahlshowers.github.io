				<h3>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...</h3>
				<p>DBC both excites me and strikes horror into the very core of my being. I find joy in the challenge of learning something new; the a-ha's provide such an overwhelming feeling of satisfaction but on the flip side - the dread, the frustration, the uncontrollable tears scare the living crap out of me.</p>

				<p>There are others, amongst our ranks that have walked away from successful careers to pursue this. I for one left 12 years in hospitality because I was tired and fed-up. I didn't have enough work/life balance to even begin to think about investing time in learning to program. I tried for six months and let me tell you, after 12 hours of being screamed at over chicken and rice there isn't much energy left to go home and lift a glass of wine to your mouth, let alone challenge your mind with learning to code!</p>

				<p>I fully expect to be taking the first train to San Francisco and the last train home, seven days a week for the duration of the program, with additional trips to meet-up before Phase 1 - minimum! I loved Shereef's analogy "If you're putting the cereal bowl back in the fridge after you're done eating it, it's time to go home!", that's pretty much what I expect, complete exhaustion from brain cramming. I'm new, so new and know that time is what I have to put in, in order to succeed. I think to expect anything less of myself, or that kidding myself it will be easy is the fastest way I can set myself up to fail.</p>

				<p>The mix of levels I see as a threat and as a huge advantage. I'm afraid I will fall behind but also see that those people can be one of the greatest assets to my learning but, only if I can get bridge that gap and use it to my advantage. I have taken a lot from the early learning on growth/fixed mindset and Search Inside Yourself and look forward to the teachings on the scope of empathetic learning</p>
